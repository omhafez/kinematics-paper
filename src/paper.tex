\abstract{The use of hypoelastic material models for applications in computational solid mechanics poses several challenges when finite deformations are taken into consideration. Namely, an appropriate objective (co-rotational) stress rate must be utilized, and a method of approximately integrating the chosen rate equation over a finite time interval must be devised. These concerns have led to the development of so-called ``incrementally objective'' algorithms, which provide a means of updating the state of stress in a material over successive increments of deformation, such that the approximation remains consistent with the particular choice of objective stress rate. Nonetheless, certain approaches may incur accumulating errors over time which can become arbitrarily large, particularly for problems involving cyclic deformations. This paper presents a ``strongly objective'' stress update algorithm based upon the Jaumann rate of stress, which relies upon an efficient polar decomposition of the deformation gradient to retain accuracy in evaluating finite element residual and consistent tangent contributions. The accuracy of the method is compared against other approaches commonly found in commercial finite element software, and its nonlinear convergence performance is examined in relation to other methods which lack algorithmic consistency.}
