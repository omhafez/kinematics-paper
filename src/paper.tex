\abstract{The use of hypoelastic material models for applications in finite deformation solid mechanics has led to the development of so-called ``incrementally objective'' algorithms, which provide a means of updating the state of stress in a material over successive increments of deformation. (Address shortcomings of current/older methods still in common use.) This paper presents a ``strongly objective'' stress update algorithm which relies upon an efficient eigendecomposition of the incremental stretch tensor to retain accuracy in evaluating finite element residual and consistent tangent contributions. The accuracy of the method is compared against other approaches commonly found in commercial finite element software, and its nonlinear convergence performance is examined when either exact or approximate tangent terms are utilized.}
